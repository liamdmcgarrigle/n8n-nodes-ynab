# Overview of YNAB Node
I created this node for personal use.

While I am currently an employee of n8n, this is an unofficial node I built in my own time. 
I have no affiliation with YNAB beyond being a user.

Haven't heard of YNAB? (Check it out here)[https://ynab.com].

# Bugs/Contributing/Feature Request

If you have a bug to report or a feature request, please [submit a GitHub issue](https://github.com/liamdmcgarrigle/n8n-nodes-ynab/issues/new) with as much detail as you're able to give.

Feel free to submit PRs, but please get in touch with me first to make sure I am willing to add the feature before you spend the time on it.
